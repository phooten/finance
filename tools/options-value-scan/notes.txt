Setup Pipenv on vscode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgwgEiC1CqE

# VS Code Running
When running in vs code, pipenv needs to be set in the trading directory or the .env
file won't work. Be careful where the debugger is run because that will source the 
.env file.

UPDATE: run "source .env" is graunteed to set .env variables
