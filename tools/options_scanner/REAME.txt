Notes:
    When API Key expires ( every 90 days ), remove the token.json, then run the script.
    It will prompt user to log in again and generate a new token.

    When running in vs code, pipenv needs to be set in the root of the repository or the .env
    file won't work. Be careful WHERE the debugger is run from because that will source the .env file.
