Status:         Open
Issue:          The maximum transactions per app has been reached. Please contact up for more information
Replication:    Got this message after in debug mode and I restarted the debug. It stopped on 'WING'
                and gave this message, so it might be the amount of stocks it cycles through?
Thoughts:       Something to do with the way it's set up on my TD APP?
