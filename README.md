# Repository Contents
input:  files containing list of stocks used for various tools
output: files containing output from tools that were run.
tools:  useful for various tasks relating to trading
util:   utility files for this repo


# REPO TODOS:
1. Finish the informative tools script about my current account
2. Create a "showme" or something for how to show tools and usage.

# New tool ideas
1. Show cost basis / profit vs loss for each stock. Maybe this can be used to show
    the status of my account. 
2. Scanner to show if if a stock drops more than 30-40% in a day.

# Notes
Really good video for how to get started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N1IxYXs4e8



Messed up and removed files that were being tracked by git ignore:
    .env
    token.json
Need to make a template for these so this doens't happen again, or it will at 
least be easier to recover.
